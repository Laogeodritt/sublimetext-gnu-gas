# Sublime Text Syntax - Generic GNU GAS

This is a Sublime Text 3 syntax definition for GNU GAS listing (*.LSS) files,
produced by GCC. These files contain mixed C/C++ source and the corresponding
compiled assembly code.

This syntax definition provides some basic highlighting to make these files
easier to read. It is a generic syntax, thus should work regardless of the
architecture being used. Note that this syntax definition assumes that the file
is correct and well-formed; its aim is to make the reading of the machine
generated listing file easier, rather than assist with manual assembly writing.

Patches and issue reports welcome!
